# Cloud Boot Application
[![Status](https://travis-ci.org/rb1whitney/cloud-boot-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rb1whitney/cloud-boot-app)

This is a basic Java Maven Spring Boot Application that will be put into the cloud either with Docker or upon a servlet container. Intention is to either use an in-memory database or mysql data back end so moving parts in the cloud can be tested. Code was heavily modified and used from https://github.com/khoubyari/spring-boot-rest-example. By default, maven will create a war artifact. If you want to instead create a jar for docker, you can use -Dpackage_type=jar when building project to do it. This project could use a multi-maven project to create both app types and optimize the jar file created, but in this case I wanted this project layout to be more simple.

### Playing with the REST Service

There are several operations you can use with this application. They are:

System:
```
Hello World: curl http://localhost:10191/cloud-boot-app
Version Servlet: curl http://localhost:10191/cloud-boot-app/version
```

CRUD:
```
Create data object: curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{ "name" : "Test Data", "description" : "This is a sample description" }' http://localhost:10191/cloud-boot-app/api/v1/data
Read all data object: curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:10191/cloud-boot-app/api/v1/data
Read single data object: curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:10191/cloud-boot-app/api/v1/data/1
Update data object: curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{ "name" : "Test Data", "description" : "This is a modified description", "id" : "1" }' http://localhost:10191/cloud-boot-app/api/v1/data/1
Delete data object: curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X DELETE http://localhost:10191/cloud-boot-app/api/v1/data/1
```

# Running the project with MySQL

This project by default uses h2 in-memory database so that I don't have to install a database in order to run it. However, converting it to run with another relational database such as MySQL is a simple matter of changing the application profile with mysql profile:

```
        java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=mysql target/cloud-boot-app-0.0.1.war
or
        mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments="spring.profiles.active=mysql"
or
        add -Dspring.profiles.active=mysql to application container
```

# Running with docker
When running with docker, I package the war as a jar with mutil-stage dockerfile using maven and Java 1.8 OpenJDK:
```
docker build -t cloud-boot-app:0.2 .
docker run -p 8090:8090 -d cloud-boot-app:0.3
```

or run it in interactive mode with to toy with files:
docker run -it -p 8090:8090 -d cloud-boot-app:0.2 /bin/bash

Currently, this project has been pushed out to docker hub under: rb1whitney/cloud-boot-app

# Using Official Oracle JDK
Using Java Oracle 8 is pretty bloated, but if you want to use it replace OpenJDK with a slimmed down first. Yeah... this is technically "illegal" docker use but do we really care?

```
RUN yum -y install wget && \
   wget --no-cookies --no-check-certificate --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" "http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/$JAVA_VERSION-$BUILD_VERSION/jdk-$JAVA_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.gz" -O /tmp/jdk.tar.gz && \
   tar -xzf /tmp/jdk.tar.gz -C /opt && \
   ln -s /opt/$JDK_NAME /opt/java && \
   yum -y remove wget && \
   rm -rf /tmp/jdk.tar.gz \
          /opt/java/*src.zip \
          /opt/java/lib/missioncontrol \
          /opt/java/lib/visualvm \
          /opt/java/lib/*javafx* \
          /opt/java/jre/lib/plugin.jar \
          /opt/java/jre/lib/ext/jfxrt.jar \
          /opt/java/jre/bin/javaws \
          /opt/java/jre/lib/javaws.jar \
          /opt/java/jre/lib/desktop \
          /opt/java/jre/plugin \
          /opt/java/jre/lib/deploy* \
          /opt/java/jre/lib/*javafx* \
          /opt/java/jre/lib/*jfx*
```


# Deploying Application with Terraform
You can deploy the application with terraform using:
If you want to use Terraform, please install it and AWS CLI client following with: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html#install-with-pip https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html

Once done, you can use "aws configure" command to setup your local provider and credentials. Terraform will use them. I recommend setting up a personalized IAM account that has adminstrator privileges in EC2 only.

After setting up Terraform with AWS, you will want a remote config to keep your state rather than your local computer. Remote State Storage is highly suggested over maintaining control state files in version control. I created in S3 US-EAST-1 the following storage bucket: tf-remote-state-storage and then with terraform ran: terraform remote config -backend=s3 -backend-config="bucket=tf-remote-state-storage" -backend-config="key=terraform.tfstate" -backend-config="region=us-east-1" -backend-config="encrypt=true".

I also wrote a script that will use terraform output for auto scaling group to get current ip addresses on spun up instances: sh find_auto_scaling_group_instances.sh <>

The organized terraform stack files with their environments files. To save configuration, I kept the module and main terraform implementation files the same and utilized tfvars to control location specific settings. You have to clear out the .terraform cache folder everytime but with the state files being in S3 I had no issues with this implementation. I created a script to help run this with: terraform_wrapper.sh <<environment:dev|prod>> <<application_type:cloud-boot-app>> <<action:apply|plan|destroy>>

Script will clear cache, set terraform state in C3, get all modules, and then invoke action (apply, destroy, plan)
